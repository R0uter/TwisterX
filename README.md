TwisterX is a twister configure manager use to one-key config twister.

Based on twister-core twister-html.It already have twisterd&twister-html inside.

##Your Chain data
Your Twister data is still stored in 'applcation support' directory.
And TwisterX do NOT include twister chain data,which means you still need wait for update the chain data if It is your first time run the twister on your Mac.
